## Installing Azure CLI Fedora 42

Why using CLI, because it is the fastest way to deploy and manage resources in Azure.
and it is available on all platforms.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/9.0/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm
sudo dnf install azure-cli
```

## Login into Azure
```bash
az login
```
